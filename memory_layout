System memory layout (VIRTUAL ADDRESSES):

SYSTEM/RESERVED:
-----------------------
0x0        - 0x400000   Identity Mapped

USER:
-----------------------
0xAFFF7FFF - 0xAFFFFFFF User Stack (32 KiB)
0xB0000000 - 0xBFBFFFFF User Heap
0xBFC00000 - 0xBFFFFFFF User Page Tables

KERNEL:
-----------------------
0xC0000000              Start
0xF0000000 - 0xF0A00000 Kernel Heap (10 MiB)
0xFFC00000 - 0xFFFFFFFF Kernel Page Tables


Only support 512 MiB of usable memory.
Max 4 processes:
    - Heap 10 MiB
    - Stack 32 KiB
    - Paging structures 4 MiB
    - Therefore a processes max size is only slightly over 14 MiB
Maybe have a value added to the physical addresses to get them to be virtual addresses?
Like have an offset of 0xC0000000. So if we are using physical address 0x10000, its virtual address
would be 0xC0010000.
Just direct map from the big usable memory entry that is around 3 GiB. To find that one just find the biggest
usable entry while ignoring the last, since the last is always outside range.
