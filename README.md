## About
ParOS is a hobby operating system that I am working on to learn operating system development. Heavily referencing [OSDev.org](https://wiki.osdev.org/). I am also following [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) for the learning theory. This was originally written as a 32-bit operating system, it is currently being rewritten in 64-bit.

## Features
- [x] Interrupts
- [x] Physical memory management
- [x] Virtual memory management (paging)
- [ ] Heap (malloc and free)
- [ ] Multiprocessing (SMP)

Currently my end goal is to be able to write programs for ParOS on ParOS. Meaning a text editor and minimal C compiler will be needed.
## Applications
- [ ] Text Editor
- [ ] Compiler
- [ ] Shell
- [ ] TUI/tmux-like interface
- [ ] Considering writing a language to run on ParOS

## Name
The name comes from the small greek island [Paros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paros). Historically, they were known for their fine white marble.
