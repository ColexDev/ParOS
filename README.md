## About
ParOS is a hobby operating system that I am working on to learn operating system development. Heavily referencing [OSDev.org](https://wiki.osdev.org/) and [Bran's Kernel Tutorial](http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/title.htm) for implementation of basics such as the GDT and interrupts. I am also following [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) for the learning theory.

## Features
- [x] Printing to the screen

The name comes from the small greek island [Paros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paros).
